# python-project-template

This is my simple template for standard python project developed in Visual Studio Code.
It will give you nice formatting tips while you're typing, re-formatting according to
the Black formatter, and optionally you can add pre-commit as well.

- `pip install cookiecutter`
- `cookiecutter https://github.com/weholt/ppt`
- `cd "project-slug"`
- `python -m venv env`
- `source env/bin/activate` or `.\env\scripts\activate`
- `pip install -r requirements.dev.in`
- `pre-commit install`

Done.
